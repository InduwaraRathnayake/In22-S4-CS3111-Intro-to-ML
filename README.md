# In22-S4-CS3111-Intro-to-ML 📚🤖

This repository contains all the works related to the course **In22-S4-CS3111-Introduction to Machine Learning**. The course covers various aspects of machine learning, including data preprocessing, feature encoding, and handling missing data.

## Contents 📂

### Notebooks 📓

1. [**Framing ML problem and feature encoding.ipynb**]():
    - This notebook focuses on framing machine learning problems and applying different feature encoding techniques such as one-hot encoding and ordinal encoding.

### Datasets 📊

The `Datasets` folder contains all the CSV files used in the notebooks.

## How to Run 🏃‍♂️

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/InduwaraRathnayake/In22-S4-CS3111-Intro-to-ML.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd In22-S4-CS3111-Intro-to-ML
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks to explore the code and run the cells.

## Google Colab 🌐

Here I have used Google Colab, therefore when you run the notebook you should have the correct path for loading the dataset:

```python
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("/Datasets/data-one-hot-encoder.csv")
```
